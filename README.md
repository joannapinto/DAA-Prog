Algorithm Implementation and Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of various algorithms and techniques as per the given tasks in Part A and Part B. The focus is on string matching, searching, graph algorithms, and sorting techniques, with additional analysis on their efficiency.
Contents
Part A
1.	Brute Force String Matching: Searches for a five-character pattern in a twenty-character string.
2.	Binary Search: Searches for a number in a list of fifty randomly generated numbers and displays the position if the number is found.
3.	Floyd's Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths in a directed graph.
4.	Warshall's Algorithm: Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph.
5.	Sorting Algorithms: Implements one of the following sorting algorithms.
   
a) Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list into two halves based on the pivot, recursively sorting them.
b) Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order, repeated until the list is sorted.
c) Selection Sort: An algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the beginning of the list.
d) Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by comparing and inserting each new element into its correct position.
e) Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted list.
Each sorting algorithm will measure the time taken to sort lists of varying sizes (n) and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

Part B
1.	Topological Sorting: Performs a topological sort on a directed graph.
2.	Horspool's Algorithm for String Matching: Searches for a five-character pattern in a twenty-character string using Horspoolâ€™s algorithm. Displays the shift table and the result.
3.	Heap Sort: Sorts a set of numbers using the bottom-up approach.
4.	Breadth-First Search (BFS): Prints all nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph.
5.	Depth-First Search (DFS): Checks whether a given graph is connected.
